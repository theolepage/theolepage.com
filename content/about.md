I am Theo Lepage, a **Ph.D. student** in **Artificial Intelligence** at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) and [EPITA Research Laboratory](https://www.lre.epita.fr/), based in Paris, France. My research focuses on **self-supervised learning** frameworks to develop robust representations for **speaker and language recognition**. Through machine learning and speech processing, my aim is to enhance communications between humans and computers.
